# Introduction

Shows a hello world example which first creates and links a shared library.

This also shows how to create an link:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#alias-targets[alias target]

The files in this tutorial are below:

```
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── shared
│       └── Hello.h
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Contains the CMake commands you wish to run
  * link:include/shared/Hello.h[] - The header file to include
  * link:src/Hello.cpp[] - A source file to compile
  * link:src/main.cpp[] - The source file with main


# Concepts

## Adding a Shared Library（创建一个动态库）

As with the previous example on static libraries, the +add_library()+ function
is also used to create a shared library from some source files.
This is called as follows:

（*使用关键自SHARED-动态，这将创建一个名为libhello_library.so的动态库文件*）

[source,cmake]
----
add_library(hello_library SHARED
    src/Hello.cpp
)
----

This will be used to create a shared library with the name libhello_library.so with
the sources passed to the +add_library()+ function.

## Alias Target

As the name suggests an link:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#alias-targets[alias target] is an alternative name for a target that can be used instead of the real target name in read-only contexts.

[source,cmake]
----
add_library(hello::library ALIAS hello_library)
----

As shown below, this allows you to reference the target using the alias name when linking it against other targets.

## 添加包含目录

----
target_include_directories(hello_library PUBLIC {PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
----

## Linking a Shared Library

Linking a shared library is the same as linking a static library. When creating your
executable use the the +target_link_library()+ function to point to your library

[source,cmake]
----
add_executable(hello_binary
    src/main.cpp
)

target_link_libraries(hello_binary
    PRIVATE
        hello::library
)
----

This tells CMake to link the hello_library against the hello_binary executable using the alias target name.

An example of this being called by the linker is

```
/usr/bin/c++ CMakeFiles/hello_binary.dir/src/main.cpp.o -o hello_binary -rdynamic libhello_library.so -Wl,-rpath,/home/matrim/workspace/cmake-examples/01-basic/D-shared-library/build
```

# Building the Example

$ mkdir build

$ cd build
