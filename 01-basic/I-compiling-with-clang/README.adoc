# Introduction

When building with CMake it is possible to set the C and C++ compiler. This example
is the same as the link:../A-hello-cmake[hello-cmake] example except that it shows the most basic
method of changing the compiler from the default gcc to http://clang.llvm.org/[clang].

（*以下介绍了将编译器从默认的gcc更改为clang的最基本的方式*）

The files in this tutorial are below:

```
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Contains the CMake commands you wish to run
  * link:main.cpp[] - A simple "Hello World" cpp file.

# Concepts

### Compiler Option

CMake exposes options to control the programs used to compile and link your code. These
programs include:

  * CMAKE_C_COMPILER - The program used to compile c code.
  * CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER - The program used to compile c++ code.
  * CMAKE_LINKER - The program used to link your binary.

[NOTE]
====
In this example clang-3.6 is installed via the command `sudo apt-get install clang-3.6`
====

[NOTE]
====
This is the most basic and easiest way to invoke clang. Future examples will show better
ways to invoke the compiler.
====


### Setting Flags

As described in the link:../F-build-type[Build Type] example, you can set CMake options
using either a cmake gui or by passing from the command line.

Below is an example of passing the compiler via the command line.

[source,cmake]
----
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-3.6 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-3.6
----

After setting these options, when your run `make` clang will be used to compile your binary. This
can be seen from the following lines in the make output.

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/clang++-3.6     -o CMakeFiles/hello_cmake.dir/main.cpp.o -c /home/matrim/workspace/cmake-examples/01-basic/I-compiling-with-clang/main.cpp
Linking CXX executable hello_cmake
/usr/bin/cmake -E cmake_link_script CMakeFiles/hello_cmake.dir/link.txt --verbose=1
/usr/bin/clang++-3.6       CMakeFiles/hello_cmake.dir/main.cpp.o  -o hello_cmake -rdynamic

# Building the Examples

Below is sample output from building this example.

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build.clang

$ cd build.clang/
