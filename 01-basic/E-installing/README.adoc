# Introduction

This example shows how to generate a `make install` target to install files and
binaries on your system. This is based on the previous shared library example.

The files in this tutorial are below:

```
$ tree
.
├── cmake-examples.conf
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── installing
│       └── Hello.h
├── README.adoc
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Contains the CMake commands you wish to run
  * link:cmake-examples.conf[] - An example configuration file
  * link:include/installing/Hello.h[] - The header file to include
  * link:src/Hello.cpp[] - A source file to compile
  * link:src/main.cpp[] - The source file with main

# Concepts

## Installing

CMake offers the ability to add a `make install` target to allow a user to
install binaries, libraries and other files. The base install location is controlled
by the variable +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+ which can be set using cmake or by calling
cmake with `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/location`

The files that are installed are controlled by the https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/install.html[+install()+] function.

[source,cmake]
----
install (TARGETS cmake_examples_inst_bin
    DESTINATION bin)
----

Install the binary generated from the target cmake_examples_inst_bin target to
the destination +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin+

[source,cmake]
----
install (TARGETS cmake_examples_inst
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib)
----

Install the shared library generated from the target cmake_examples_inst target to
the destination +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib+

[NOTE]
====
This may not work on windows. On platforms that have DLL targets you
may need to add the following

[source,cmake]
----
install (TARGETS cmake_examples_inst
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
    RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)
----
====


[source,cmake]
----
install(DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/ 
    DESTINATION include)
----

Install the header files for developing against the +cmake_examples_inst+ library
into the +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include+ directory.

[source,cmake]
----
install (FILES cmake-examples.conf
    DESTINATION etc)
----

Install a configuration file to the destination +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/etc+

After `make install` has been run, CMake generates an install_manifest.txt file
which includes details on all installed files.

[NOTE]
====
If you run the `make install` command as root, the install_manifest.txt file will
be owned by root.

If `/usr/local/lib` is not in your library path you may need to add it to the
path before running the binary.

Extra Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[default-location]]
Overriding the default install location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned the default install location is set from the +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+,
which defaults to `/usr/local/`

If you want to change this default location for all users you can add the
following code to your top level CMakeLists.txt before adding any binaries or
libraries.

[source,cmake]
----
if( CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT )
  message(STATUS "Setting default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path to ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/install")
  set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/install" CACHE STRING "The path to use for make install" FORCE)
endif()
----

This example sets the default install location to under your build directory.

[[destdir]]
DESTDIR
^^^^^^^

If you wish to stage your install to confirm that all files are included the
`make install` target supports the DESTDIR argument.

```
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/stage
```

This will create the install path `${DESTDIR}/${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` for all
your installation files. In this example, it would install all files under the
path `/tmp/stage/usr/local`

```
$ tree /tmp/stage
/tmp/stage
└── usr
    └── local
        ├── bin
        │   └── cmake_examples_inst_bin
        ├── etc
        │   └── cmake-examples.conf
        └── lib
            └── libcmake_examples_inst.so
```

[[uninstall]]
Uninstall
^^^^^^^^^

By default CMake does not add a `make uninstall` target. For details on how to generate
an uninstall target see this https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Can_I_do_.22make_uninstall.22_with_CMake.3F[FAQ]

For an easy way to remove the files from this example, you can use:

```
sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```
