# Introduction

This example shows how to call the
https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/[Clang Static Analyzer] to do static analysis using the
scan-build tool.

The files included in this example are:

```
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── subproject1
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main1.cpp
└── subproject2
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── main2.cpp
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Top level CMakeLists.txt
  * link:subproject1/CMakeLists.txt[] - CMake commands for subproject 1
  * link:subproject1/main.cpp[] - source for a subproject with no errors
  * link:subproject2/CMakeLists.txt[] - CMake commands for subproject 2
  * link:subproject2/main2.cpp[] - source for a subproject that includes errors

# Requirements

To run this example you must have clang analyzer and the scan-build tool installed. This can be installed on Ubuntu using the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install clang
----

It will result in the tool being available as:

[source,bash]
----
$ scan-build-3.6
----

# Concepts

## scan-build

To run clang static analyzer you can use the tool `scan-build` to run the analyzer when you
also run the compiler. This overrides the CC and CXX environment variables and replaces them with it's own tools. To run it you can do

[source,bash]
----
$ scan-build-3.6 cmake ..
$ scan-build-3.6 make
----

By default this will run the standard compiler for your platform, i.e. `gcc` on linux. However, if you want to override this you can change the command to:

[source,bash]
----
$ scan-build-3.6 --use-cc=clang-3.6 --use-c++=clang++-3.6 -o ./scanbuildout/ make
----

## scan-build output

scan-build will only output warnings during compile time and will also generate a list of HTML files which contain detailed analysis of the error.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd scanbuildout/
$ tree

    ├── index.html
    ├── report-42eba1.html
    ├── scanview.css
    └── sorttable.js

1 directory, 4 files
----

By default these are output to +/tmp/scanbuildout/{run folder}+. You can change this using `scan-build -o /output/folder`.
