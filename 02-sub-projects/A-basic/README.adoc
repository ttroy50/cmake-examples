# Introduction

This example shows how to setup a CMake project that includes sub-projects. The
top level CMakeLists.txt calls the CMakeLists.txt in the sub directories to
create the following:

  * sublibrary1 - A static library
  * sublibrary2 - A header only library
  * subbinary - An executable

The files included in this example are:

```
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── subbinary
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.cpp
├── sublibrary1
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── include
│   │   └── sublib1
│   │       └── sublib1.h
│   └── src
│       └── sublib1.cpp
└── sublibrary2
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── include
        └── sublib2
            └── sublib2.h
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Top level CMakeLists.txt
  * link:subbinary/CMakeLists.txt[] - to make the executable
  * link:subbinary/main.cpp[] - source for the executable
  * link:sublibrary1/CMakeLists.txt[] - to make a static library
  * link:sublibrary1/include/sublib1/sublib1.h[]
  * link:sublibrary1/src/sublib1.cpp[]
  * link:sublibrary2/CMakeLists.txt[] - to setup header only library
  * link:sublibrary2/include/sublib2/sublib2.h[]

[TIP]
====
In this example I have moved the header files to a subfolder under each projects +include+
directory, while leaving the target include as the root +include+ folder. This is a good idea to prevent 
filename clashes because you have to include a file like below:

*不是直接将头文件放在include下，而是放在include/header/header.h,并且将target的包含目录设置为～/include，这样在一个项目含有多个头文件时可以有效防止文件名冲突*

[source,cpp]
----
#include "sublib1/sublib1.h"
----

This also means that if you install your library for other users the default install location would be
+/usr/local/include/sublib1/sublib1.h+.

# Concepts

## Adding a Sub-Directory

A CMakeLists.txt file can include and call sub-directories which include a CMakeLists.txt
files.(利用 `add_subdirectory()` 函数一个CMakeLists.txt文件可以包含和调用一个含有CMakeLists.txt文件的子目录)

[source,cmake]
----
add_subdirectory(sublibrary1)
add_subdirectory(sublibrary2)
add_subdirectory(subbinary)
----

## Referencing Sub-Project Directories

When a project is created using the `project()` command, CMake will automatically
create a number of variables which can be used to reference details about the project.
These variables can then be used by other sub-projects or the main project. For example,
to reference the source directory for a different project you can use.
（当使用 `project()` 创建一个项目时，CMake会自动创建一系列可以用来引用该项目相关信息的变量。这些变量可以被子项目或主项目使用）

[source,cmake]
----
    ${sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR}
    ${sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR}
----

The variables created by CMake include:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Info
|PROJECT_NAME | The name of the project set by the current `project()`.

|CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME |the name of the first project set by the `project()`
command, i.e. the top level project.

|PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR |The source directory of the current project.

|PROJECT_BINARY_DIR |The build directory for the current project.

|name_SOURCE_DIR | The source directory of the project called "name".
In this example the source directories created would be `sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR`,
`sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR`, and `subbinary_SOURCE_DIR`

|name_BINARY_DIR | The binary directory of the project called "name".
In this example the binary directories created would be `sublibrary1_BINARY_DIR`,
`sublibrary2_BINARY_DIR`, and `subbinary_BINARY_DIR`

|=======================================================================

## Header only Libraries（*只含头文件的库，利用INTERFACE*）

If you have a library that is created as a header only library, cmake supports the +INTERFACE+
target to allow creating a target without any build output. More details can be found from
link:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/add_library.html#interface-libraries[here]

[source,cmake]
----
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} INTERFACE)
----

When creating the target you can also include directories for that target using
the +INTERFACE+ scope. The +INTERFACE+ scope is use to make target requirements that are used in any Libraries
that link this target but not in the compilation of the target itself.

[source,cmake]
----
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
    INTERFACE
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)
----

## Referencing Libraries from Sub-Projects（*引用子目录中的库*）

If a sub-project creates a library, it can be referenced by other projects by
calling the name of the target in the `target_link_libraries()` command. This
means that you don't have to reference the full path of the new library and it
is added as a dependency.（*在某项目中创建的target名，可在子目录或主目录中调用，可以说其作用域为整个项目*）

[source,cmake]
----
target_link_libraries(subbinary
    PUBLIC
        sublibrary1
)
----

Alternatively, you can create an alias target which allows you to reference the
target in read only contexts.（*当然target的别名同样是全局作用域，只不过是只读的*）

To create an alias target run:

[source,cmake]
----
add_library(sublibrary2)
add_library(sub::lib2 ALIAS sublibrary2)
----

To reference the alias, just it as follows:
[source,cmake]
----
target_link_libraries(subbinary
    sub::lib2
)
----

## Include directories from sub-projects

When adding the libraries from the sub-projects, starting from cmake v3, there is
no need to add the projects include directories in the include directories of the
binary using them.

This is controlled by the scope in the `target_include_directories()` command when creating
the libraries. In this example because the subbinary executable links the sublibrary1
and sublibrary2 libraries it will automatically include the `${sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR}/include`
and `${sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR}/include` folders as they are exported with the
 +PUBLIC+ and +INTERFACE+ scopes of the libraries.
